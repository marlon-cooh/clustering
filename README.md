# Clustering

Clustering is a type of Unsupervised Machine Learning Modelling, herein data is grouped without targeting a variable, these algorithms allow to assort 2D or 3D dataframes to classify and find valuable patterns.

Within clustering types, we find:

- 1. `K-Means`: Random centers are displayed within data clusters and closest data to them are fitted.

- 2. `Hierarchical Clustering`: Data is comprehensively grouped from closest data points up to large groups that compose the entire dataset. This clustering is represented as a dendrogram, where distances among root and nodes show how near are.

- 3. `DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering)` : Based on high density clustering separation where viccinity radius of points, known as epsilon term (Îµ), is varied along with a number of minimal points close to them (n).
